# IPlocator
A simple IP geolocator written with jQuery.

Why ?
-----
I wanted to quickly know where the people who connected to my honeypot came from and I didn't feel like searching for a tool that could do it. That's just it. 

Usage
-----
Simply add a list of ip addresses at called `addresses` in this folder, set your API key in the script, and open `map.html` to find out where all these addresses come from.

Requirements/Credits
--------------------
This small tool uses Google Maps, jQuery, and requests infos about IP addresses from ipinfo.io. This has been tested on Firefox 43.
